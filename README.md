## Introduction
A number of blocks are stored without any specific order on a stand located within the workspace of a robotic manipulator (Ur5). The manipulator is an anthropomorphic arm, with a spherical wrist and a two-fingered gripper as end-effector. Objects can belong to different classes but have a known geometry. The goal of the project is to use the manipulator to pick the objects in sequence and to position them on a different location according to a specified order. A calibrated 3D camera is used to locate the different objects and to detect their position in the stand.
